# seaoferl

A limited erlang environment created from Joe Armstrong's example in Programming Erlang version 2 (https://pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang2/programming-erlang-2nd-edition/)

To test, you'll need to build the boot file:

```
erlc *.erl
erl -s see make_scripts
```

You should then be able to run your restricted erlang on some files:

`./see see_test1`
